<h1>Fighter Round</h1>
We are honoring five local people who battled cancer
this year by making them
Honorary Captains of the tournament.  By doing this, we bring the
focus back to why we're joining forces and raising lots of money-to get rid
of this terrible disease called cancer.  The fighters or a family member play a game of
bean bags in our Fighter/Survivor Round along with a local celebrity of
their choice.  We will also share some stories about these fighters
battles with this awful disease.
<p>
<h2>This Years Honorary Captains are:</h2>

<b>In Memory of Bryce Thalmann (June 21, 2013 - January 9, 2015)</b><br>
</center>
The Thalmann family is from Henning, MN.  Bryce Thalmann was not only a charming little boy that has no doubt touched the hearts of others with his big smile &amp; blue eyes, 
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/bryce1.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/bryce1.jpg" /></a>
but he was "Thalmann Tuff!"  
<p>
Some of Bryce's favorite things were playing with toys; especially the farm animals that he often toted around in his hands.  He also loved live animals too; his favorites were cats, dogs, horses &amp; cows.  His face would light up when he would see the family dog, Gus.  Listening to music &amp; dancing is also something that Bryce liked to do. 
<p>
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/BrycePacManGameInDiaper.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/BrycePacManGameInDiaper.jpg" /></a>
It was in September of 2014 that Bryce was diagnosed with a malignant Rhabdoid Liver tumor, which is a rare and aggressive type of tumor.  Despite the difficult news &amp; challenges that lay ahead, the Thalmann family was prepared to give the cancer a good fight.  After being diagnosed, Bryce spent quite a bit of time in the hospital, having tests and receiving rounds of chemotherapy.
<p>
The most special times for the family were when they were all able to spend time together.  Bryce's dad, Nathan, and older sister, Klare, would visit mother, Kristy &amp; Bryce on the weekends. 
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/BryceSisterBigSmiles.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="250" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/BryceSisterBigSmiles.jpg" /></a>
 Bryce &amp; Klare would be able to play together and they could watch movies, such as Frozen. Between treatments, Bryce was able to go home for a few days. This would allow the family to spend more time together visiting the farm, or go sledding in the wintertime.
<p>
It is with much sadness, that despite treatment, the Rhabdoid tumor started to again grow &amp; Bryce passed away on January 9, 2015, a few months shy of his second birthday. 
<p>
Bryce is survived by his loving parents, Nathan &amp; Kristy; sister, Klare; grandparents, Dick &amp; Mary Trana of Henning and Pete &amp; Renae Thalmann of Ottertail; great-grandparents, Roland &amp; LaVay Thalmann, Florence Guse, and Eleanor Trana Hildreth; many other relatives and a host of friends.

<b>In Memory of Jon Hoopman</b><br>
</center>
<b>Andrew</b> (14 years old) &amp; <b>Evan</b> (9 years old) Hoopman are brothers and will participate in the 2015 Cabin Fever Fighter Round in memory of their father, Jon Hoopman.  Jon was born and raised in Rochester, MN.  
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/jon4.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/jon4.jpg" /></a>
He passed away December 16, 2014, at the age of 40 years old, after 1 &amp; 1/2  years of battling esophageal cancer. <br>
<p>
Jon had many hobbies that revolved around an active lifestyle, and being with his friends &amp; family. He enjoyed being outside, swimming, biking, playing softball, kickball, volleyball, and golf. Jon was also a fan of professional sports, especially hockey. 
<p>
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/jon2.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/jon2.jpg" /></a>
Andrew &amp; Evan are both kind-hearted, generous boys, and much like their Dad, they share similar interests.  Andrew loves the outdoors, he enjoys baseball, going fishing &amp; being with friends.  Evan enjoys reading, arts &amp; crafts, soccer, swimming, ice skating, and playing video games. The boys &amp; their Dad, Jon, were able to share in all of these activities together.  One of the <a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/jon3.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="250"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/jon3.jpg" /></a>
last wonderful memories Andrew &amp; Evan will be able to cherish was the time they spent with their Dad at a Minnesota Wild game this past November. 
<p>
Because of their interests in sports and the outdoors, Andrew will be playing 
in the Fighter Round with brothers <b>Matt and Joe Meyer</b>, both from Rochester, MN.  Matt, a Boston College graduate, player and coach, pitched in the minor leagues for the Cleveland Indians (AAA), St. Louis Cardinals (AA) and the LA Angels of Anaheim (AAA).  Joe worked in football equipment management with the Minnesota Gophers, NY Jets, San Francisco 49ers, Army Black Knights and the Atlanta Falcons.  Evan will be playing in the Fighter Round with <b>Slider</b>, the one and only Rochester Honker's mascot!

With big, beautiful brown eyes, a smile that could melt anyone's heart, Miss Isabella Schlatter is a 7 year-old first-grader at Howard-Winneshiek Elementary in Cresco, Iowa. She enjoys her country 
home and wooded acres with her parents, Angela and Jeff Schlatter in Lime Springs, IA, along with 
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Isabella2.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Isabella2.jpg" /></a>
her big sister Mercadez (14) and little brother Chase (2). <br>
<p>
In November 2013, Isabella's mom noticed a bump in-between Isabella's shoulder blades, that appeared to be under the skin, yet the skin surface felt different. Isabella was seen by a doctor; the bump was considered a wart and she left with a prescription cream to apply and treat the wart. The "bump" did change throughout the next few months as cream was applied, but Angela felt it was not reacting like a wart should. In spring of 2014, Isabella was taken to the doctor for a strep test and since they were there, Angela had the doctor take a second look at the "bump" to see why the wart was looking the way it did. It was determined at that visit that the "bump" needed to be removed as soon as possible, as it did not look right. The removal was delayed until the strep was treated and gone. A few weeks later, the surgery took place, removing the bump and skin around it in the shape of an eye-socket. Pathology tests, among others, were run. Days later, Angela received a phone call she never thought she'd receive; her sweet baby girl tested positive for skin cancer. Isabella, along with her parents, was to report to Rochester as soon as possible to learn more. In June 2014, Isabella at the age of 6, was diagnosed and began treatment for Melanoma. 
<p>
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Isabella3.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="250"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Isabella3.jpg" /></a>
As the first step in treatment, Isabella needed to endure another surgery to remove the cancer from her skin with a goal to gain clear margins around the cancer site. In addition to a much larger skin removal, a few lymph nodes were removed to be tested. Success was achieved in obtaining clear margins and removing all cancer from the site, however a small amount of cancer was detected in one lymph node. Isabella had to have an additional surgery to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the pocket that the cancer was found. 
<p>
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Isabella4.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="250"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Isabella4.jpg" /></a>
Isabella's parents are happy to report that Isabella is N.E.D. (no evidence of disease)!! At this time, Isabella's treatment course is to report to Mayo Clinic for the next two years, every three months for PET scans, blood work and a look-over of her entire body. This form of cancer has a 40-50% chance to return in the first two years. At this time, she applies sun-screen every few hours every day; even the fluorescent lights at school can be harmful for her. Isabella will remain at-risk forever and needs to take extra care and caution with her skin.

Isabella didn't allow this to change her or what she does! She continues to be a sweet, loving, care-free little lady. She loves animals and enjoys painting, dancing, swimming, softball, being with her friends and playing with her siblings. When asking her what she wanted to be when she was

<center><b>Emma Crossman</b></center><br>
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma1.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="300"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma1.jpg" /></a>
Described by her mom, Malynda Jordahl, as a diva, with a big heart and fun personality, Miss Emma Crossman is 6 years old and would be a kindergartener at Elton Hills; currently she is being home-schooled with a tutor.
<p>
In March 2014, Emma crawled into her mama's bed complaining about a bellyache. Shortly after, she began vomiting and couldn't stop. Malynda took her little lady to a walk-in clinic and she was treated for a UTI and was told to bring her back into the ER if vomiting began again. Later that day, Malynda took Emma to the ER with severe abdominal pain. After CT scans of her abdomen, it was discovered she had some sort of tumors on her kidneys and possibly on one of her lungs. Emma was transferred from Olmsted Medical Center to St. Mary's Hospital, immediately. After more tests, Emma was diagnosed with Wilm's Tumors. According to the Mayo Clinic website, Wilm's Tumor is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Wilm's Tumor most often affects children ages 3-4 and becomes less common after the age of 5; in addition it often occurs in just one kidney. Emma was 5, but it affected both kidneys along with lesions in her lungs.  Improvements in the treatment of Wilm's Tumor have improved the prognosis for children with this cancer. The outlook for most children with Wilm's tumor is very good. 
<p>
Once diagnosed, a port-line was placed and chemotherapy treatments immediately began. Emma was continuously in-and-out of the hospital, but remained strong and in good spirits. In April, she began to lose her hair from the chemo and she was scared to be bald. 
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma2.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma2.jpg" /></a>
Her mom, Malynda, did what any amazing, loving, strong mama would do…she shaved her own head! In June 2014, Emma endured an 8-hour surgery to successfully remove the tumors; her kidneys were okay! 
On September 19th, little Miss Emma had her last chemo treatment! In October, her port-line was <a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma4.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma4.jpg" /></a>
removed via surgery, a step in the direction to be a normal kid - yay! The next course of action was to report to Mayo every three months to have scans and blood work done. Later in October, 
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma3.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma3.jpg" /></a>
Malynda and Emma traveled to Florida where Emma would be a flower-girl for a 25-year cancer 
survivor having her wedding at a Pre-KISS Kruise Party (…yes, that KISS, the iconic, hard rocking band). As a surprise for Emma, she was chosen to go on the KISS Kruise the very next day! Emma was a cancer victor and was headed back to school!  
<p>
On Christmas morning 2014, a few short days after her first 3-month check when things were looking good, Emma went to the bathroom and there was blood in her urine. Malynda did not have a good feeling, but it was important to her to let Emma open her Christmas presents at home before taking her to the hospital. Once at the ER, a CT scan and ultrasounds were completed. 
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma5.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma5.jpg" /></a>
Those tests showed that tumors had returned in both of her kidneys (one kidney tumor was 9x7 inches!!), liver and bladder. She had a biopsy two days later and a pic-line placed. On Tuesday, January 30th, it was confirmed that the Wilm's Tumor had returned and Emma would begin her second battle with cancer. Doctors told Malynda that Emma is seriously ill; however they do remain hopeful that the chemo will shrink the tumors. Therefore, chemo treatments began immediately with hopes to shrink the tumors as fast as possible. On February 9th of this year, Emma began her formal treatment plan - a 29 day cycle - that will be repeated four times, with small breaks in-between 
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma6.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Emma6.jpg" /></a>
cycles. The cycles will consist of 4-5 days in the hospital, and getting an intense dose of chemo each day.  Then she gets a break at home, IF she is well enough.  Then, she must endure an outpatient 90-min chemo drip for 5 days, then another break. It's not going to be easy, but Emma is strong and determined. 
<p>
Emma is an energetic, strong-willed, smart, crafty, and extremely sweet little girl. And most importantly, she's a proven fighter! Emma likes anything KISS, Hello Kitty, Frozen and playing with make-up! She is playing in the Fighter Round with <b>Alexis Simmons</b> (dressed in character) and one of her nurses at Mayo, Pediatric Registered Nurse, <b>Bob Smith</b>!

<center><b>Carter Simonson</b></center><br>
Athletic, competitive and determined are some of the personality traits for Mr. Carter Simonson. He is a 7 year-old, first-grader at Churchill Elementary in Rochester, MN. He is the oldest of three 
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter2.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter2.jpg" /></a>
boys and very much a leader of his younger brothers, Caden (4) and Colin (8 months). His parents, Cory and Cindy Simonson, certainly have a very busy, active household...full of boy things! 
<p>
On December 8th, 2013, Carter appeared to have swollen glands in his neck, so his mom kept him home from kindergarten and took him to the doctor. After an examination and a negative strep test, he was sent home being told it was something viral. He continued with his daily activities of school and wrestling practice for a few days; nights became taxing because of his difficulty in sleeping. 
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter3.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter3.jpg" /></a>
Carter was very fatigued &amp; bruised easily from wrestling, so much so that he didn't want to go to practice anymore. After 10 days of his neck not getting better, Cindy took him to a different doctor for an exam. The doctor thought it was a bacterial infection, and therefore prescribed him antibiotics. Before dismissing Carter, he wanted to do blood work to see if he could have mononucleosis. Carter and Cindy were sent home; the doctor telling Cindy he would call her with his blood work results the following day. Cindy missed the phone call from the doctor, but was left with a message to call on him on his cell phone. She returned the call, worried that Carter had mono and would need to take it easy for 6 weeks. Never did she think she would hear what the doctor had to say; he was making plans to have Carter admitted to St. Mary's Hospital, immediately. He wanted further testing done to determine whether it was mononucleosis or leukemia. Cory was called,
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter4.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter4.jpg" /></a>
 and the three of them headed to the hospital. After several tests were completed, Carter was diagnosed with T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-Cell ALL). 
<p>
Treatment began immediately with a port-line being placed and chemotherapy administered. Carter had to spend his 6th birthday and most of Christmas in the hospital in 2013. There were many hospital stays from December 2013 through August 2014. Any time Carter would get a fever, it often resulted 
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter5.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="300"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter5.jpg" /></a>
in a hospital visit as his immune system was highly compromised given his treatment. Currently, Carter is in his maintenance phase of his treatment plan. He takes a daily chemotherapy pill, along with 4 other medications throughout the month. He goes to Mayo Clinic once-a-month for blood work. He will have his port-line in until he's done with his treatment, therefore this active little man has to be sidelined in some of his favorite sports for a little while longer.

Carter is an avid sports fan! He loves wrestling, but his passions are football and baseball. You will find him cheering strongly for the Minnesota Twins and the San Francisco 49ers! Boy does this guy love the 49ers. When Carter was diagnosed, his mom Cindy was pregnant with his youngest brother.
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter7.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter7.jpg" /></a>
 Because Cory and Cindy struggled with agreeing on a boy name and because Carter was fighting cancer like a champion, they gave Carter the honor of naming his brother. There was one rule; the
 <a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter8.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="200"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/Carter8.jpg" /></a>
 name had to start with a "C" to match the rest of the family!  Without hesitation, Carter named his brother Colin Joseph. Colin, after the 49ers current quarterback, Colin Kaepernick; and Joseph, after the 49ers legendary quarterback, Joe Montana! You will also hear Carter cheer for the Minnesota Vikings because of his local hero, Marcus Sherels. Sorry Marcus, your name didn't meet the naming rule! 
<p>
When you can get Carter to slow down, you will learn that he is a very funny, sweet, smart beyond his years, young man! If you are willing to throw a ball, shoot hoops or talk sports, you will certainly be this guy's buddy. When asked what he wants to do when he grows up - he's very detailed - "I want to play football for 10 years, baseball 10 years and then own a pizza restaurant!" Carter will be playing in the Fighter Round with his Rochester hero, <b>Marcus Sherels</b>, a cornerback and return specialist with the Minnesota Vikings!

Lacey McClain is a Cabin Fever Honorary Captain Alumnus from last year's event.  At that time, her hospital stay prevented her from being part of the Fighter Round in person, though we communicated with her at the event.  We're very thankful and happy to state that, this year, she'll be joining us in person and in good health as a Survivor!  
<p>
Lacey is a very positive, sweet, active, strong-willed sixth grader from Pine Island who has recently won her battle against T Cell Leukemia!  This victory is in-part, due to a stem-cell transplant.  Lacey began the transplant process on May 24, 2014, and was in the hospital until July 12th of last year.  But thankfully, she hasn't been back since, 
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lacey1.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lacey1.jpg" /></a>and is recovering wonderfully!  
<p>
Lacey is looking forward to playing softball this spring and summer and she is working on getting strong enough for gymnastics!!  She loves playing violin, swimming, riding bike, and spending time with her hamster &amp; her Holland Lop rabbit.  She also enjoys playing softball with her friends on the Pine Island girls' softball team, going clam digging, dressing up and wearing makeup, hats and jewelry.  She loves children, especially babies.  And she can't wait to get back to being the active young lady (who can also be a tough tomboy) she was before her diagnosis!  
<p>
Lacey's family includes four siblings, Alex, Isaiah, Beau, and Lonee along with her mother, Chrissie, and her stepfather, Adam.  Lacey has chosen <b>Danielle Teal</b> as her Hero for the Cabin Fever Fighter Round.  Danielle has given Lacey wonderful support through her fight with leukemia.  Danielle made a New Year's resolution in 2013 to perform an act of kindness every day for someone else, and Lacey has been the deserving recipient of many of these wonderful acts. For Lacey, keeping a positive attitude and trusting God throughout her battle are what helped her through the hard times. When things are difficult, she maintains a radiant smile on her beautiful face!
