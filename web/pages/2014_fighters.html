<h1>Fighter Round</h1>
We are honoring three local people who battled cancer
this year by making them
Honorary Captains of the tournament.  By doing this, we bring the
focus back to why we're joining forces and raising lots of money-to get rid
of this terrible disease called cancer.  The fighters or a family member play a game of
bean bags in our Fighter/Survivor Round along with a local celebrity of
their choice.  We will also share some stories about these fighters
battles with this awful disease.
<p>
<h2>This Years Honorary Captains are:</h2>

<b>Lydia Joy Pankratz</b>, AKA “Lyd”, is a beautiful, strong, intelligent 13 year old middle school student who has almost completely beat Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).  She’s battled this disease since September, 2012 with more spirit and positivity than you can imagine!  
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lydia2.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0"  width="250"src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lydia2.jpg" /></a>
Her middle name says it all - Joy.  Rarely do you see her without a smile.  And this isn’t just any old smile.  It is a genuine and contagious smile that truly lights up the room and the people in it.  With her smile, she makes you feel comfortable in any situation.  It doesn’t matter if she’s had a rough day or a rough week; that bright smile still shines through. Lydia enjoys playing basketball, swimming, interacting with her youth group, doing nails, watching the Food Network, and cheering on the Twins, Vikings and Nebraska Cornhuskers.  
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lydia3.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lydia3.jpg" /></a>
Her family, which has been such an amazing support for her, is made up of her father Tom, mother Angie, sisters Eva (11) and Anna (8) and brother Danny (6).  Lydia and her family have had absolutely amazing support from their friends, family, co-workers, fellow Autumn Ridge patrons, and the Oncology staff at Mayo Clinic.  Lydia’s Prayer Warriors and her faith have gotten her and her family through this challenging time.  Her positive attitude is truly inspiring!  Thank you so much to Lydia, her family and her Nurse Practitioner, Donna Betcher for becoming part of our Cabin Fever family!

<b>Lacey McClain</b> is a very positive, sweet, active, strong-willed fifth grader from Pine Island who is currently battling T Cell Leukemia.  T Cell Leukemia is a very rare form of leukemia.  Fortunately, she is currently awaiting a bone marrow transplant which is scheduled for mid-March.  Lacey is very excited for this opportunity and she’s also happy that it means she’s nearly done with chemotherapy!  Lacey loves to play the violin, play softball with her friends on the Pine Island girls’ softball team, swim, ride bike, spend time with her hamster and Holland Lop rabbit and go clam digging, wear makeup, hats and jewelry, and staying busy doing all <a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lacey1.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/lacey1.jpg" /></a>
of the other fun things that go along with being an eleven year old girl!  
She loves children, especially babies.  Prior to her diagnosis she was a very active young lady who also knows how to be a tough tomboy!  Lacey’s family includes four siblings, Alex, Isaiah, Beau, and Lonee along with her mother, Chrissie, and her stepfather, Adam.  
Lacey chose Danielle Teal as her hero for this event.  Danielle has given Lacey wonderful support through her fight with leukemia.  Danielle made a New Year’s resolution last year to perform an act of kindness every day for someone else, and Lacey has been the deserving recipient of many of these wonderful acts.  
For Lacey, keeping a positive attitude trusting God throughout her battle is what has helped her through the hard times.  When things are difficult, she maintains a radiant smile on her beautiful face!

<b>Ashlynn</b>, <b>Myca</b>, and <b>Amelia Reynolds</b> will be participating in this year’s Fighter Round in memory of their father <b>Wade</b>, who lost his battle with cancer on December 16, 2013.  
<a style="float:right;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/wade5.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="200" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/wade5.jpg" /></a>
Wade was very active in his church, enjoyed sports, but most important to him was his family.  He enjoyed watching his children's activities, camping and continually dating his wife, Melissa. Wade was known for his integrity, humbleness, sly humor and was “bigntender.” Before his death, Wade was able to do many fun things with his children. 
<a style="float:left;margin:5px" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/wade1.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" width="300" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14824619/CF/web/fighters/wade1.jpg" /></a>
In November, his entire family went on a trip to New York and Washington D.C. where they took in the sights and created memories. Wade surely is missed.
Wade’s children are joined by his wife and their mother Melissa.
