<h1>Fighter Round</h1>
Last year, for the first time at our event, we honored four local
kids that are battling cancer (and kicking it's butt) by making them
Honorary Captains of the tournament.  By doing this, we brought the
focus back to why we're joining forces and raising lots of money-to get rid
of this terrible disease called cancer.  The kids played a game of
bean bags in our Fighter/Survivor Round along with a local celebrity of
their choice.  We also shared some stories about these strong kids'
battles with this awful disease.
<p>
<h2>Last Years Honorary Captains were:</h2>

He loves baseball, especially the Minnesota Twins. Hunter's dad brought him to his first Twins game on his 3rd birthday. 
He fell in love with baseball that day. Hunter became a fan of Torii HUNTER of the Detroit Tigers (who played for the Twins at the time) when he saw his own name on the back of Torii's jersey that day. Hunter has gone to a Twins game on or near his birthday ever since. Hunter also enjoys golf. In fact, he is planning to host a golf benefit this summer to raise money to support childhood cancer research! We encourage all of you to join us when the date and location are finalized!.

Warriors to help him beat this disease.  He also enjoys watching funny
movies...especially ones featuring Jack Black or Adam Sandler!

sports a huge smile and is a funny man himself and has continued to be
full of jokes...never missing an opportunity to make his doctors,
nurses, family and friends laugh during his treatments. Wyatt is a sweet, caring young man and has a giggle that is contagious, but don't be fooled, his scar is proof that he is one tough little guy who shall not be messed with on the wrestling mat...Go Wyatt! Wyatt's partner is his Papa, <i>Ted Perzynski</i>, who has become his best friend after spending many days and nights with Wyatt while in the hospital for his cancer treatments...Papas are awesome!!
