    <i>Thank you Cabin Fever team for an excellent day for Hunter. He commented several times on the way home how much
      fun he had. Everyone was so great and Marcus was so very kind to him. He was especially excited about the Torri
      Hunter ball he was given. I can't thank you all enough for providing my son a great day that he will remember for
      a very long time I'm sure. Not only for the fun part of the day but for Hunter to see and hear from all the people
      that care about supporting cancer research first hand. Just in the year Hunter has been in treatment we have seen
      some of the results and progress they have made in the treatments thanks to research.
      Thank you ALL for the hard work you put into this event and helping to further cancer research.</i>

    Past Tournaments
  </h2>

  <h3>2013</h3>

  2013 was a banner year for Cabin Fever! We grew dramatically to 128 teams and changed venues to the Rochester
  International Event Center to handle the growth. With the larger space we were able to add many new activities to the
  event including the Fighter Round, live entertainment, karaoke, Bargo, a giant screen sports TV lounge, and many
  others. In addition we had a greatly expanded silent auction. The result was a smashing success as we raised and
  donated over $53,000 to the Eagles Cancer Telethon! This is all thanks to YOU and we cannot say enough how much we
  appreciate your fantastic support!

  <h3>2012</h3>

  In 2012 we hosted 80 teams and donated over $29,000 to the Eagles Cancer Telethon! WOW! We had a great event and made
  a significant contribution for this important cause. Of course this was only possible thanks to our many sponsors,
  raffle donors, and participants. Thank you all!

  <h3>2011</h3>

  In 2011 we were able to donate over $13,000 thanks to our many supporters and 64 bean bag teams. This year was the
  year of the "Handsome Ransom" (thanks Brad!) and a venue change to the Clarion Inn. A huge thanks to the many sponsors
  and raffle donors who made the tournament a success!!!

  <h3>2010</h3>

  The inaugural Cabin Fever Bean Bag Tournament to help overcome "cabin fever" and more importantly raise money to
  battle cancer. With wonderful success, we were able to host over 50 teams and donate over $5,000 to the Eagle's Cancer
  Telethon!
