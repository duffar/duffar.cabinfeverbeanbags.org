    interpretation of the rules.

  <h3>
    RULE 1 - PITCHING DISTANCES
  </h3>
  All contestants shall pitch from the pitcherâ€™s box behind the the foul line (front of the board you are throwing
  from). Platforms are to be placed 25 ft apart (front to front).
  <h3>
    RULE 2 - PLAY OF THE GAME
  </h3>
  Two contestants are partnered against another team of two contestants. One member of each team pitches from one bean
  bag platform and the other members pitch from the other bean bag platform.
  Every bean bag match is broken down into innings of play. During each inning of play each contestant must pitch all
  four bean bags.
  <h3>
    RULE 3 - SCORING
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Bean Bag In-The-Hole</b> - A bean bag in-the-hole (or Hole-In) is a bean bag which is thrown through the hole
      in the platform or otherwise comes to rest inside the platform (knocked in by another player or an act of God). A
      bean bag in-the-hole has a value of three points.
    </li>
    <li><b>Bean Bag In-The-Count</b> - A bean bag that is not in-the-hole but lands with any portion of the bean bag
      resting on the platform is in-the-count. A bean bag in-the-count has a value of one point. For a bean bag to be
      in-the-count, it must not touch the ground or any other portion of the court prior to coming to rest on the
      platform. If a bean bag touches the ground before coming to rest on the platform, it is a foul and must be removed
      from the platform prior to the continuation of play.
    </li>
    <li><b>Bean Bag Out-Of-The-Count</b> - A bean bag which comes to rest anywhere except in-the-count or in-the-hole is
      out-of-the-count and has no scoring value. A bean bag which is declared to be a foul is considered to be
      out-of-the-count (no matter where it comes to rest) and must be removed from the surface prior to the continuation
      of play.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b>Cancellation Scoring</b> - Bean bags in-the-hole and bean bags in-the-count pitched by opponents during an inning
  cancel each other out. Only non cancelled bean bags are counted in the score for the inning.
  <p>
    Cancellation scoring may be easily calculated as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>The points of both contestants are calculated for hole-ins and in-the-count bean bags.</li>
    <li>The total points of the lowest scoring contestant are subtracted from the points of the highest scoring
      contestant. The result is a score for only 1 team per half inning (or no score if no bags are in or on the
      platform).
    </li>
    <li>The score is for the current half inning is cumulative and added to the previous total for the scoring team.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>
    RULE 4 - DELIVERY OF THE BEAN BAGS
  </h3>
  The first side of contestants alternate pitching bean bags until they have thrown all four bean bags, then the
  remaining contestants (pitching from the other beanbag platform) continue to alternate in the same manner until all
  four bean bags are delivered and the inning completed.
  <h3>
    RULE 5 - PITCHING ROTATION DURING THE GAME
  </h3>
  The team who scored in the preceding inning shall pitch first in the next inning. If neither team scored in the
  previous inning, the contestant whose team scored last shall pitch first again.
  <h3>
    RULE 6 - FOUL BEAN BAGS
  </h3>

  <p>
    A foul bean bag is a bag which was delivered in non-compliance with one of the rules of the game. It scores as a
    bean bag out of the count and is to be removed from the court before any more bags are pitched. Bean bags already in
    the court that have been knocked into foul territory by a foul bean bag should be returned to the scoring area.
    Additionally, bean bags that are in the count, but are knocked into the hole by a foul bean bag must be returned to
    their original scoring position.
  <ol>
    <li>The following are rule violations that must be spotted and called by a contestant or assigned judge. The penalty
      is to declare the bean bag a foul bag, which requires the bean bags to be removed from the court prior to resuming
      play.
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>Any bean bag pitched when the contestant has made contact with or crossed over the foul line before the bean
        bag is released.
      </li>
      <li>Any bean bag that leaves a contestant's hand once the final forward swing of the delivery process has started
        shall count as a pitched bean bag. A bean bag that is accidentally dropped by a contestant before the final
        forward swing has started shall not be considered foul and may be picked up and pitched.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>
    RULE 7 - LENGTH OF THE GAME
  </h3>

  <p>
    <u>Point Limits</u> - The Bean Bag match shall be played until the first team of contestants reaches (or exceeds) 21
    points at the completion of an inning; however, games will be limited to 30 minutes. If no winner has been
    determined at the end of the 30 minutes play will continue under sudden death rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    <u>The Inning Must Be finished</u> - The Bean Bag match can never end in the middle of an inning. Thus, if a team
    that pitches first reaches or exceeds 21 points, the game can not end until the other side is allowed to pitch all
    of their bean bags and the inning is completed.
